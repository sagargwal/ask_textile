What factors can influence the sensitivity to fabric-evoked prickle in individuals?,"['Individuals can vary considerably in their sensitivity to fabric-evoked prickle. Psychophysical measurement of prickle threshold in a group showed that the mean threshold-stimulus intensity was lower for females and progressively increased with age.

Use of ﬁ ner ﬁ bres, chemical processes which reduce the bending modulus of the ﬁ bre, and the ﬁ nishing processes of brushing and raising, which increase the length of protruding ﬁ bres, will reduce prickle. In contrast to this, the ﬁ nishing process of cropping, which shortens the protruding ﬁ bres, tends to worsen the prickle discomfort. All the above can be explained in terms of buckling theory.\n\nInitial warm/cool feeling', 'Increasing ﬁ bre diameter also increases the sensation of scratchiness and prickliness (dealt with in Chapter 8). In the case of wool it is the ﬁ bres coarser than 30 μm that are mainly responsible for the sensations of prickli- ness and scratchiness.

If, then, the differences between successive readings were plotted, a graph such as (b) was obtained, which indicated by its peaks the positions where the greatest rates of change occurred.

What part of the knee is most frequently injured when an ACL is ruptured?,"['best explains the pattern of bone injuries observed in acute ACL disruption. As the body comes to a sudden halt, anterior translation of the internally rotated tibia of the flexed knee occurs, and as the femur translates posteri- orly, it externally rotates and its lateral edge catches the rim of the tibia. A complete rupture of the two bundles will lead to increased anterior tibial translation and internal rotation, resulting in instability and giving way.', 'The frequency of associated injuries varies depending on the mechanism of injury: medial meniscal tear (25–31%), lateral meniscal tear (2–41%), medial collateral lig- ament injury (4–8%). Moore observed more tears in the lateral meniscus in acute rupture, the medial meniscus being more associated with chronic pathologies (Moore, 2002). Cartilage tears may also be observed in 23% of acute rupture. The definition and diagnosis of partial ACL tear is not clear. Biomechanically, opinions vary whether a partial tear repre- sents failure in the absence of gross macroscopic disruption due to microscopic rup- ture of collagen fibrils, or whether the process begins with microfailure and progresses to involve major fibre bundles and finally the entire ligament (Duri and Aichroth, 1995). Clinically, the patient with a partial tear may have pain that will last several days/weeks compared with the complete rupture where the pain is at the moment of the injury followed by symptoms of giving way.', 'the patient with a partial tear may have pain that will last several days/weeks compared with the complete rupture where the pain is at the moment of the injury followed by symptoms of giving way. Thereafter, the patient with a partial tear may experience locking or pseudolocking symptoms. The diagno- sis is arthroscopic because the physical examination is often inconclusive and mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI) is unreliable for partial ACL tear. The partial disruption can occur anywhere along the ligament, the superoanterior attachment being the most frequent, followed by the posterolateral band and intrasubstance tears. Given that part of the function is lost, conservative treatment should focus on aggres- sive rehabilitation to regain a functional and stable knee before more invasive mea- sures are undertaken.', 'When an ACL is ruptured, the axis of rotation shifts more medially and the tibial rotation causes a coupled anterior tibial translation, magnifying the movements of the tibial plateau (Mannel et al., 2004; Amis et al., 2005).

Strategic positioning involves selecting and then bringing to bear an integrated set of tools and communication techniques that identify and explain the store to the customer.”\n\nWalters [18] offers a model of positioning developed as the consequence of wide-ranging empirical research within the retail sector. The fundamentals of the positioning strategy in retailing, he suggests, are a visible response to the needs and wants of the identified target market. The key decision areas for retailers in evolving their marketing strategy are those of trading format, merchandise strategy, customer service and customer communications strategy. These decision areas define the retailer positioning strategy, and position them in terms of what the customer anticipates and customer satisfaction, creating a point of distinction which separates retailers from their competitors and represents the retail brand [82, 26].', 'and design. Methods of production have advanced to meet the ever-increasing needs of the consumer. Factories have to be lean, mean and, above all, disciplined environments in order to survive in an increasingly competitive world. Companies have to be able to change and adapt to the market place more quickly, and more efficiently, and have faster response times if they are to survive.', 'While established as a theoretical model, the strategic elements of Walters’s [18] value added positioning statement are still recognised in the retail marketing literature as the means by which retailers should position themselves in the market [17-26].\n\nTherefore it forms the basis of a number of empirical studies on retailer brand positioning [20, 26, 81, 83-88, 89, 90], which stress the possible benefits of developing a clear and distinctive positioning statement using the elements of the retailing mix. Consequently it was thought to be the most suitable framework for application within this study. However, although there are a number of positioning typologies developed in the marketing and retailing planning context [59, 73-74], there is still a lack of empirical research testing these typologies [61, 64].']","Some features that can influence the strategic positioning of a product include:

How do the clearances between the shell and the feed roller affect the average fibre length in the card sliver?,"['The clearances between the shell and the feed roller, the shell and the cylinder, and the feed roller and the cylinder can be altered to give a selection of operating conditions. These settings can have a considerable bearing upon the average fibre length in the card sliver and since it is axiomatic that as long a fibre length as possible is desired, the shell settings assume considerable importance. In general, any adjustment which exposes the jute to prolonged combing at the shell will reduce the fibre length, though naturally sufficient time must elapse to allow the essential opening, splitting, and cleaning to be achieved. Alterations in the combing time come about through changes in the rate of fibre feed. For example, if the fibre is fed at 8 ft/mip, then each inch of the reed will pass over the shell edge in 9~ min, but if the feed rate is altered to 16 ftlmin, then each inch will pass over the shell in 1 h min, i.e. half the time. Like the spreader, the breaker card is a', 'this distance,\n\nFigure 7.3 shows the fibre length distribution of a jute finisher card sliver placed alongside the drafting zone of_ a first drawing frame and\n\n,\n\nki&U ffi\n\n,\n\n, ,\n\nI\n\nI I\n\nI :\n\n\'"" .s 40 \'"" 20\n\nc\n\n~ Q) Cl..\n\n2 Fibre length and front reach (in.)\n\n8 9\n\nFigure 7.3.

From the squared fringe, a small tuft, similar to that shown in Fig. 4.13 but containing about 500 fibres, was withdrawn and passed slowly downwards through a pair of delivery rollers. Since the leading ends of the fibres in the tuft were aligned, the rotation of the rollers released the fibres in succession according to their length, the shortest first and the longest last.', ""The other important variable is the clearance between the shell and the feeder roller. The greater the distance between the two the lighter is the grip on the jute and the more easily is it dragged into the card by the cylinder pins. This has the same effect as reducing the time of combing, i.e. less breakage occurs. Table 6.2 gives a summary of the results of an experiment where two shell/feed-roller settings were used and the yarn properties examined.\n\nThe jute processed with the closer shell setting had a shorter average fibre length and poorer yarn properties.

What is the purpose of computer-aided design (CAD) in the textile industry?,"['This chapter tells the story of a group of researchers who determined in the early 1990s to approach the computer-aided design (CAD) of textiles from the opposite direction to that previously adopted by researchers or developers in this field. Despite over a decade of endeavour this project remains work in progress and due to the complexity of the subject and the reactionary nature of the industry it will probably continue as such for some time to come. The different approach taken by this group can be summed up quite simply. When a fabric is to be designed and then produced, it is first necessary to choose a suitable yarn with the required aesthetic and mechanical properties. It is therefore logical that if an accurate computer simulation of a fabric is to be produced, we should begin with the accurate simulation of the component yarn. As with all simple statements of concept, the implications of this statement are far reaching. The chapter will try to explain these implications and', 'Due to the demand for TE scaffolds, as well as the high costs of the in vitro and in vivo stages of the research and development work, designing and modelling tools could highly benefit the field. There are numerous computer software packages avail- able for designing and modelling textiles, depending on the type of the manufacturing process used. Computer-aided design (CAD) is also used by the textile industry to improve work and documentation. CAD programs aid the engineering of textile assemblies in order to define structures, predict mechanical properties, and carry out common calculations. The programs input weave and knit patterns along with the yarn properties.

What is the estimated torque for a 42 dtex polyester fibre with a wrap angle of 90°?,"['M = Mt + 1/2 Fr\n\nwhere Mt is given by equation (19.7), F is the total frictional force over the whole length on both sides of the centre point and r is the fibre radius.\n\nThe variation in torque along the test length is indicated in Fig. 19.52. By putting in what seemed to be reasonable values of the various parameters, Calil et al. estimated that the torque due to hysteresis (‘internal friction’) would be at least ten times as large as the torque due to surface friction. For a 42 dtex polyester fibre with a wrap angle of 90°, the torque was estimated to be in excess of 1 µN m, which would produce in excess of 1 turn/mm. This is in reasonable agreement with the angles of the helical splits found in fatigue failures by biaxial rotation. Clearly, the torque contributes in an important way to the failure of the fibres, which will have been weakened by the tension/compression action in cyclic bending.\n\nTorque\n\nPosition\n\nActual\n\nNominal contact', '0\n\n80 Surface shear strain (%)\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4 Time (s)\n\n6\n\n17.18 Development of tension and torque in an 80 µm diameter nylon monofilament twisted at 5 turns/second.

The torque is obtained from the twist of the torsion wire, which is calculated from the angle turned through by C. Values are noted at intervals as the test is in progress. The same apparatus can be used for measuring the relaxation of torque. With sensitive transducers, the method could be automated [41].', 'The above analysis is only valid for small twist. In Figure 17.17, AC = AB sec φ, which causes a tensile strain of (sec φ – 1), increasing from the centre to the outside, where ϕ equals the twist angle α. Table 17.7 compares the shear strain, equal to tan α, with the tensile strain. At low twists, tensile strain can be neglected, but it must be taken into account at high twists, particularly as tensile modulus is greater than shear modulus. The tensile strains will be strongest for twisting at constant length. Figure 17.18 shows the development of torque and tension in a nylon monofilament twisted at constant length. At zero tension, the fibre will contract on twisting, reducing the tensile strain at the outside but giving a compressive strain at the centre.\n\n17.3.2 Experimental methods', '2.4\n\n) e u q r o t\n\n2.1\n\n70 turns/cm\n\ne v i t a l e r (\n\ng o L\n\n1.8\n\n5 turns/cm\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nLog (time, min)\n\n17.23 Relaxation of torque [47].\n\n17.3.5 Breaking twist\n\nIf a fibre is twisted far enough, it will eventually rupture.

What is an advantage of using UV inks in terms of print head maintenance?,"['on maintenance. UV inks can provide good colour value and when optimised accurately.

Jettability and drop placement accuracy of the inkjet print head depend on the interaction of inks with the print head and its components. It also important to note that nature of ink plays a vital role in terms of technical performance which is defined by the level of interactions between the inks and the substrates.

How does the thermal conductivity of silk compare to that of cotton?,"['489\n\n(6.1)\n\n(6.2)\n\ntextilestudycenter.com\n\n490\n\nP. Kandha Vadivu\n\nstructure of silk fabric. Silk fiber contains higher thermal insulation value as it has lower thermal conductivity (50 mw/m/k) than cotton (71 mw/m/k).', 'Silk, like wool, is an animal fiber and unlike wool, its molecules are in extended form. The protein molecules in silk are highly oriented in the direction of the fiber and can pack tightly together. The forces of attraction between the molecules interact effectively to give the molecular bundles very great strength. The effect of heat on silk is similar to its effect on wool. Thus, at a high temperature, silk will burn. But the molecules in silk are not joined together by cross-links as in wool; so, there are no cross-links between the molecules to break down or rebuild. Silk is therefore able to withstand higher temperatures than wool.\n\n1.3\n\nRegenerated fibers', '6.2. Thermal Insulation\n\nThermal insulation property of the fabric refers to the ability to resist the transmission of heat by all modes. It can also be defined as effectiveness of a fabric in maintaining the normal temperature of the body under equilibrium conditions. The most important thermal property in most of the apparels is the insulation against heat flow, which is measured by thermal resistance. It is defined as the ratio between temperature difference between the two faces and heat flux.\n\nThe thermal resistance, R and thermal conductivity, K are related as follows,\n\nR = d /K\n\nWhere d is the thickness of the material. Since K is roughly constant for different fabrics, hence thermal resistance is approximately proportional to fabric thickness. Thermal insulation value is higher in case of silk fabric compared to cotton fabric. It is due to openness of knit\n\n489\n\n(6.1)\n\n(6.2)\n\ntextilestudycenter.com\n\n490\n\nP.

What type of symmetry do the constructions follow in the dendritic branching rules?,"['surface at G 1.0. As a result of this reiterative branch cell assembly, it is apparent that these constructions follow systematic dendritic branching rules, with radial symmetry giving a well-deﬁned three-dimensional geometry to the ﬁnal dendritic product.3', 'dendrimers made, using a divergent strategy, is the Starburst® poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer family (Scheme 1).2 This method involved assembling repeat units to introduce branch cells around the initiator core through successive chemical reactions at the peri- phery of the growing macromolecule. The ﬁrst step of PAMAM synthesis involves Michael addition of four moles of methyl acrylate to the nucle- ophilic ethylenediamine core. This leads to an electrophilic carbomethoxy surface, which is then allowed to react with an excess of 1,2-diaminoethane to give a nucleophilic surface at generation zero. Reiteration of these two steps now involves addition of 8 mol of methyl acrylate to give G trophilic, carbomethoxy surface). This is followed by amidation to return to a nucleophilic surface at G 1.0.

It should be noted that both crystallographic forms coexist in ﬁbres spun from solutions of intermediate concentration. Northolt and Chapoy24 proposed that hydrogen bonds are formed between adjacent chains lying in the 100 plane. They argued that the chain conformation is primarily governed by competitive intramolecular interactions between the conjugated groups in the chain. Similar interactions are also found for the conformation of ben- zamide, acetanilide and the terephthalamide molecules. These interactions arise from the operation of a resonance effect, which results from an attempt to stabilise coplanarity of the amide groups and the phenylene groups.A counteracting steric hindrance is also found between the oxygen and the ortho-hydrogen of the p-phenylene diamine segment, and', '(i.e. hydrogen). Conversely, rotation around proline residues is restricted owing to the unusual structure of the side chain of this amino acid.
